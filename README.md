# Bare-Metal CV

Bare-Metal CV is a minimal (yet professional), beginner-friendly CV/resume template in ~100 lines of LaTeX

To use it, open [main.tex](main.tex) (either copy/paste or download it) in your favorite LaTeX editor (if you don't have one, use [overleaf](https://overleaf.com))

No obscure LaTeX packages, just `geometry`, `hyperref` and `enumitem` (plus a the `charter` font).

No weird commands, configuration settings or hard to understand syntactic sugars.

Just a single file containing ~100 lines of simple, easy to understand LaTeX code.
